Explanation of the Test

Mocking Dependencies:
useTodosContext is mocked to return an object with a addTodo function.
useNavigate is mocked to return a navigate function.

Rendering the Component:
The AddTodo component is rendered using render from React Testing Library.

Simulating User Interaction:
The input field is found using screen.getByRole("textbox").
The submit button is found using screen.getByRole("button", { name: /add todo/i }).
The fireEvent.change and fireEvent.click methods simulate user input and form submission.

Assertions:
addTodoMock is checked to ensure it was called with the correct arguments.
navigateMock is checked to ensure it was called with the correct route ("/todos").

Notes
The id in the addTodo call is generated using Date.now(), so we use expect.any(Number) to match any number.

Ensure that the AddTodoForm component is properly tested separately, as this test assumes it works correctly.

This test ensures that the AddTodo component behaves as expected when the form is submitted.
